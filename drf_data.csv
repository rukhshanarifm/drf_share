The minor boy had gone to his madressah near his home on Monday but went missing around 4:30pm when it was time for him to return home, according to Zahoor Ahmed, a relative of the child.

The family reported the child missing and searched for him along with police through the night, to no avail.

At 9am on Tuesday, police informed the family that the minor boy's body was found from a hill near Kalat. The body was brought to Quetta for autopsy.

Dr Ayesha, a police surgeon, while speaking to Dawn confirmed that the child had been raped ""by more than one person"". She said his skull had been fractured due to being hit by a stone.

Samples collected during the post-mortem examination will be sent to Lahore and their result will be received in a week's time, the doctor added.

Balochistan government spokesperson Liaquat Shahwani condemned the incident, saying he was ""concerned at the increase in incidents of sexual violence"".

Shahwani said a case had been registered of the incident at the concerned police station and nine suspects had been arrested.

According to a spokesperson for the regional office of the Ministry of Human Rights, more than 40 cases of child abuse have been reported in Balochistan so far this year.

Earlier this month, the body of an eight-year-old boy who was murdered after allegedly being raped was found hanging from a tree in Balochistan's Killa Abdullah district.

In August, a report by the NGO Sahil had revealed that as many as 1,489 children, at least eight per day, were sexually abused in the first half of the ongoing year in the country. The victims included 785 girls and 704 boys.

The abusers were acquaintances of the victims or victims’ families in 822 cases while strangers were involved in 135 reported cases, according to the report titled 'Cruel Numbers'.

The report said that in 98 cases, the victims were between the age of one to five years; in 331 cases, they were between six and 10 years of age; while the largest number of cases (490) involved victims between 11 to 15 years of age.","['Ghalib Nihad', 'Raja Raman', 'Ali Mehdi', 'Zeeshan Ahmed', 'Abdur R.

As per police report, the nine-year-old girl along with her younger brother was grazing cattle in the fields when an unidentified young man, son of a landlord, raped her while his servant (identified in the report) stood guard.

The FIR was registered by Saddar Police under Section 376 PPC.

The father of the victim girl told the media that his minor daughter was gang-raped by both the suspects and her condition was critical.

He alleged that police did not register a case of gang-rape and they did not include the name of son of the landlord and nominated only his servant. He said police forced him to sign a blank paper.

When newsmen asked him to identify the son of the landlord, he said his family were received threats from the landlord’s family. He said he would identify the other suspect if he was given security.

Investigating officer Sub-Inspector Akhtar Hiussain refuted the allegations of the girl’s father, saying that both the suspects would be arrested after the statement of the girl and if the reports of medical ad DNA tests showed it as a gang-rape case. He said police were not favouring anybody.

The crime occurred in Kaneri Langla village of Jhelum Valley district, about 55 km south of the AJK capital, reportedly over two weeks ago. It was “settled” by a local Jirga which imposed a punishment on the suspects, primarily in cash and in default of payment banishment from the village, said Raja Ansar Sajjad, the station house officer (SHO) of Hattian Bala.

“When we came to know about the offence from local sources, we sent a police team to the village to ascertain the facts,” he said, adding the team returned with the victim and her elder sister for their statements.

According to their statements, two sons of their stepbrothers had separately raped the girl at least four times.

According to the SHO, one of the suspects was married and in his mid-20s while the other was 18-year-old.

The medical examination of the girl conducted by a doctor at a Hattian Bala hospital the same evening confirmed the commission of rape following which an FIR was registered under section 10 of Offence of Zina (Enforcement of Hudood) Act 1985.

In the meanwhile, those who were part of the Jirga were also summoned to the police station and asked to produce the suspects or else they would be arrested, he said.

The Jirga members, he said, had imposed a fine of Rs200,000 each on the suspects, failing which they had to expatriate themselves to some other areas.

The SHO assumed that since both were unable to pay the penalty and also feared strong reaction from the public and police, they fled to Mirpur and Rawalakot.

Riyaz Mughal, Superintendent of Police (SP) in Jhelum Valley, told reporters that eventually police arrested both the suspects within 24 hours.

He said one of the suspects had been shifted to Hattian Bala and produced before a magistrate for physical remand on Tuesday while the other suspect would be produced before the magistrate on Wednesday, he said.

Police have deployed a heavy contingent to the village to maintain law and order there.

According to the FIR lodged with the city police station, the suspect, who is said to be the father of several children, tricked the young victim and took her to some agriculture fields where he assaulted her.

The suspect’s brother told reporters that his family had handed over his brother to police. “If my brother is involved in such a heinous crime, we will not back him at any platform. Let the court decide his fate,” he said.

Police, however, did not confirm the suspect’s arrest.

Meanwhile, students of various schools and colleges mounted a protest against the assault on the four-year-old girl and called for public hanging of the suspect.

Enraged by rape of the minor girl, students took out a procession from Abbotta­bad road to Khatm-i-Nubu­wat chowk where a demonstration was held that was addressed by student leaders.

Speaking to the audience, one of them said the government should deal with an “iron hand” all the cases involving rape of women and assault on children which were increasing by the day.

He was of the opinion that the government should ens­ure that the affected family got justice as soon as possible and the culprit was hanged publicly so that he became an example for others.

“We cannot allow such gruesome incidents in our society where the father of many children assaults a four-year-old girl,” said another student leader.

According to local media reports, eight suspects have been arrested so far in the case.

Khan said that initial investigation ""suggests that the minor was assaulted before her murder"", adding that there were torture marks on the girl's body. Police are waiting for a medical report to confirm more details.

Police said that in a case filed by Shahzeb, a resident of Johar Colony Baseline, in Millat Town police station, it had been stated that his paternal aunt was travelling to Faisalabad from Sahiwal.

When she reached near Faisalabad from Lari Adda in a rickshaw, she lost her way and was unable to find her nephew’s house.

Meanwhile, taking advantage of the situation, the accused Muzammil Hussain, Raja and others, abducted the victim and took her to one the suspects’ house where they raped her.

The alleged rapists also looted Rs50,000 cash and clothes from the victim and ‘sent her back’ to Sahiwal from Lari Adda. The victim informed her family after she reached Sahiwal.

Millat Town police registered a case against the accused under Section 376TP.

Meanwhile, another woman was gang raped by the accused Arshad, Asif and Latif. The victim was alone in her house located in suburban village 73GB when the incident took place.

As per details available with The Express Tribune, this was the second time this victim was raped by the accused Arshad.

The alleged rapist had also raped the same victim around a year ago after which he was arrested. However, the accused was released from jail after certain witnesses reportedly gave a false testimony in the case of 766/19 crime 376 TP in Thikriwala police station.

Police registered a case against the three accused under Section 376TPP.

Moreover, an 11-year-old boy, the son of Muhammad Tahir was called by the accused Iftikhar to his farm in the suburban village 170GB. The accused then took the minor to Faisal Kamad area where he raped him.

Separately, in Chak No 383GB, Amjad Ali teenage daughter was sleeping alone in her house when the accused Ijaz and Jahan Khan barged into her residence and attempted to rape her. However, the victim resisted and screamed which caught the attention of nearby people.

Police registered a case under Section 376/511 and started searching for the accused. Cases of sexual assault have been on the rise in the district.

According to figures obtained by The Express Tribune, more than 300 cases of rape and 72 of attempted rape have been reported in the district during the past nine months.

On August 15, three victims including two minors and a teenage girl were raped by men in separate incidents in the city.

The chief minister has taken notice of these incidents and directed the police to arrest the culprits.

In the Bismillah Colony, Shoaib alias Shabbi along with his three accomplices allegedly poisoned his newly-wed wife, Afsana Bibi, whom he had married 10 days ago of her own free will.

Afsana’s mother, Jannat Bibi, in her first information report (FIR) registered at the Civil Lines police station under sections 302 and 34 of the PPC alleged that right after the marriage, Shoaib had started to torture her daughter to get her share in the family property.

On finding out about the torture, she rushed to her daughter’s house and saw that Shoaib along with Shama Bibi, Sana Bibi and Zafar had administered poison to her daughter, who was lying on the floor in a precarious condition. On seeing her there, the suspects fled from the scene, Jannat alleged. She took her daughter to Bahawal Victoria Hospital (BVH) in a rickshaw, but she died on the way. No arrest was made till the filing of this report.

In the second incident, Javed Qadir allegedly tortured his wife Parveen and chopped off one of her legs with an axe near village 132/DNB.

According to the FIR registered under sections 334 and 34 of PPC against four people, Parveen had a family dispute with Qadir who used to torture her time and again. The suspect also took his wife’s chopped leg with him while fleeing. She was shifted to the THQ hospital where her condition was stated to be serious.

Chief Minister Usman Buzdar has taken notice of both the incidents and directed the local police officials to arrest the culprits.

IQBALIAT DEPT: The Islamia University (IUB) has decided to establish a department of ‘Iqbaliat’ on philosopher and poet Allama Iqbal.

This was announced by IUB Vice Chancellor (VC) Prof Dr Athar Mehboob at an event held at the Ghotvi Hall of the university’s Abbasia Campus on Monday night in connection with Iqbal’s 143rd birth anniversary.

The IUB has had a joint department of Urdu and Iqbaliat since its establishment. But after the VC’s announcement, the department would be bifurcated.

The VC, while paying homage to Allama Iqbal, said the poet’s personality, ideology, poetry and sayings were in fact precious national assets. An independent department of Iqbaliat was necessitated as his work needed a thorough research by knowledge-seekers of the university.

He added that Iqbal’s poetry carried an eternal message and for its dissemination the IUB would make efforts across the world.

According to police, the girl was abducted by an accused Noman and four other accomplices on gunpoint and later was gang-raped by the five men at a house.

The accused were able to run away from the house as soon as the relatives of the victim reached there.

The police have registered a case against the accused as women police are further probing regarding the matter.

It is pertinent to mention here that a girl committed suicide a day after being raped by a landlord in Bahawalpur district of Punjab province.

According to ARY News correspondent, the rape victim’s father claimed that his daughter was raped by a landlord named Luqman within the precincts of Khairpur Tamewali police station of Bahawalpur District but police didn’t register a First Information Report (FIR) despite several attempts and requests by the family.

He maintained that his daughter today consumed pesticide spray to commit suicide.

Tahira reportedly wrote a suicide note to her father which read, “People will remember you for raising an honourable daughter who took her life upon denial of justice and you can now live with honour”.

The suspect Luqman allegedly raped Tahira a day ago in the fields near Khairpur Tamewali but when she and her father went to the local police station, the police impeded FIR and referred them to a police check-post.

Soon after the ARY News reported the incident, Punjab Minister for Information, Fayyazul Hassan Chohan informed the channel that Chief Minister Punjab Usman Buzdar immediately took notice of the incident and ordered DPO Bahawalpur to take action.

Reports said Kunwal Parveen had married a man of her choice some 10 years ago without consent of her family. Later, the family had reconciled with the woman.

On Tuesday, the woman, a mother of three, was called to attend the ceremony of birth of son of her maternal uncle. When she visited the house, her nine-year-old nephew Najamul Hassan alias Waqas fired on her with a pistol, killing her on the spot.

Although Saddar police registered a case against the minor boy, they believed that the woman was killed for honour and the suspect was trained for it by the family.

Police have arrested the minor and gave him in the custody of his father. Further investigation is under way.

Kasur in the spotlight

In the last few years, Kasur has been rocked by multiple incidents of abuse, rape and killings of children. As many as 251 cases of rape, gang rape and child abuse have been reported and cases have been registered in the first half of 2020 alone.

The district came into the spotlight in 2015, when a child pornography ring was busted in the district's Hussain Khanwala village. Hundreds of video clips had emerged showing a gang forcing dozens of minor boys and girls to perform sexual acts and filming them. The gang had also used the videos to blackmail the children's families and extort millions in cash and jewellery from them.

In 2018, nationwide protests broke out when Zainab Ansari, a six-year-old, was found dead in a trash heap near Shahbaz Khan Road, five days after she went missing. Hers was the 12th such incident to have occurred within a 10-kilometre radius in Kasur over a 12-month period.

The prime suspect, Imran Ali, had been arrested on January 23, 2018, and on June 12 of the same year the Supreme Court had turned down his appeal against the death sentence, noting that he had admitted to committing similar offences with eight other minor victims. Ali was subsequently executed in October, 2018.

In September last year, the city was shaken again when authorities recovered bodies of three minors from sand dunes near Chunian bypass.

According to police, two of the children were reported missing in Kasur's Chunian tehsil in July 2019, while the third had gone missing two days before his body, along with those of others, was recovered. On the indication of a local worker, police found the body of one of the boys and the skeletal remains of the other two at a deserted place in Chunian Industrial Estate area.

The main suspect, Sohail Shahzad, a resident of Chunian, was arrested on October 1, 2019 after his DNA matched with samples recovered from the remains of a victim. Punjab Chief Minister Usman Buzdar had announced his arrest at a detailed press conference. He was convicted for kidnapping, raping and murdering a minor boy in Chunian and handed him the death sentences on three counts.","['Afzal Ansari', 'Humble Pakistani', 'Pro Democracy', 'M.

In another case, a man allegedly raped a 15-years-old girl in Noorpur Jattan village within the Sadar Chunian police station's jurisdiction.
The victim was alone at her house when she was assaulted by the suspect, who belongs to the same village.
The juvenile suspect took the victim to the roof of his house where he was seen by some women from the village.

Area SHO Farrukh Shaharyar said that the minor had gone missing in Shafiq Colony, Block-22, F.B Area at around 6.30pm on Thursday.

The family did not lodge his missing report. Instead, announcements were made from mosques in the area at about 10.30pm.

The officer added that at about 12.30am, area residents saw a person who was carrying something wrapped in a bed sheet.

They held the man down and found the body of the boy wrapped in the cloth.

Dozens of relatives and neighbours reached the spot.

However, they did not inform the police or hand over the suspect to law enforcers.

The officer claimed that the people reportedly held a ‘jirga’ to settle the matter. However, an assistant sub-inspector, Zakir Naeem, who lives in the same area came to know about it and informed Madadgar-15.

The police rushed to the spot, took the suspect into custody and sent the body of the boy to the Abbasi Shaheed Hospital for medico-legal formalities at around 1.30am.

Quoting doctors, the SHO said apparently there were no injury marks on his body. However, there were bruises on the neck of the boy.

The doctors reserved cause of death for chemical examiner’s report.

The doctors also told the investigators that the boy had been subjected to criminal assault.

The police have registered a case against the held suspect on complaint of the victim’s father for murder and rape.

During the initial probe, the suspect sometimes admitted to raping and killing the child, but thereafter retracted his statement.

SHO Shaharyar added that the police had obtained information from the area, which revealed that the arrested man had been involved in similar cases in the past.

The suspect was stated to be a neighbour of the victim boy.

Meanwhile, relatives carrying coffin of the victim boy protested on the main road near Shafiq Mor on Friday and demanded strict punishment for the held suspect.

As a result of the protest, traffic moving from Nagan intersection to Sohrab Goth was diverted to alternative routes.

Two ‘hitmen’ held

The CTD police on Friday claimed to have arrested two suspects Munawwar Iqbal and Waseem, alias Commando, affiliated with the MQM-L in Pak Colony.

The suspects were allegedly involved in targeted killings of three policemen, two senior education officers, six Baloch youths and three workers of the Jamaat-i-Islami from 1995 to 2013, said the CTD officer, Chaudhry Ghulam Safdar.

Reportedly, the police were reluctant to register a rape case against the influential accused despite passage of a week since the sexual assault incident took place.

The victim's mother, Nazia Bibi, told APP on Tuesday that four persons kidnapped her minor son and took him to the nearby fields where they molested him turn-by-turn.

Later the accused fled the crime scene, leaving the child in a critical condition.

She further said that the victim was fighting for his life at Daska Civil Hospital for the last one week where his condition was still in danger.

She claimed that the accused were influential politically and police had not yet registered a case against them despite submission of an application a week ago.

She urged Punjab CM Sardar Usman Buzdar to ensure registration of a case against the accused and their early arrest.

When contacted, local police officials said that police were investigating the issue after registering a case. Police claimed that a case would soon be registered against the accused.

She urged Punjab CM Sardar Usman Buzdar to ensure registration of a case against the accused and their early arrest.","['accused', 'registered', 'sialkot', 'boy', 'gang', 'week', 'influential', 'claimed', 'raped', 'persons', 'case', 'daska', 'took', 'minor', 'despite']","{'https://tribune.com.pk/images/logo/express-com-pk-logo.png', 'https://tribune.com.pk/images/logo/cricketpakistan-logo.png', 'https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/1078136-ShahidJavedBurkiNew-1459699492/1078136-ShahidJavedBurkiNew-1459699492-76x58.jpg', 'https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/jdq11608977277-0/jdq11608977277-0-198x140.jpg', 'https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/1080003-rapereutersfilexx-1459983274/1080003-rapereutersfilexx-1459983274.jpg', 'https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/e-paper-1.jpg', 'https://tribune.com.pk/images/logo/express-pk-logo.png', 'https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/jan1601229841-0/jan1601229841-0-76x58.jpg', 'https://i.tribune.com.pk/assets/images/footer-tribune.logo.png', 'https://i.tribune.com.pk/assets/images/trendingbar--100.png', 'https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/811368-winterpakistanREUTERS-1419397693/811368-winterpakistanREUTERS-1419397693-198x140.jpg', 'https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/Afghan-trade1592598872-0/Afghan-trade1592598872-0-198x140.jpg', 'https://tribune.com.pk/images/logo/express-entertainment-logo.png', 'https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/ertugrul1609139685-0/ertugrul1609139685-0-76x58.jpg', 'https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/267066216082838071608284549-0/267066216082838071608284549-0-198x140.jpg', 'https://tribune.com.pk/images/logo/food-tribune-logo.png', 'https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/FotoJet-2020-12-25T162050-7471608982035-0/FotoJet-2020-12-25T162050-7471608982035-0-198x140.jpg', 'https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=UTRSn1QolK10mh', 'https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/magazine+thumbs/magazine-20201220.jpg', 'https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/1870549-aneelashahzadnew-1545244338/1870549-aneelashahzadnew-1545244338-198x140.jpg', 'https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/909107-MBilalLakhaninew-1435161131/909107-MBilalLakhaninew-1435161131-198x140.JPG', 'https://i.tribune.com.pk/assets/images/amp-home.png', 'https://tribune.com.pk/images/logo/campusguru-logo.png', 'https://tribune.com.pk/images/footer/apple.png', 'https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/logos/tribune-logo.png', 'https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/maryam-sukkur-screen1609006016-0/maryam-sukkur-screen1609006016-0-198x140.jpg', 'https://tribune.com.pk/images/footer/android.png', 'https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/11609010647-0/11609010647-0-198x140.jpg', 'https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/1078350-fazlurrehmanx-1459718938/1078350-fazlurrehmanx-1459718938-198x140.jpg', 'https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/New-kamran1601229283-0/New-kamran1601229283-0-76x58.jpg'}",True,https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/1080003-rapereutersfilexx-1459983274/1080003-rapereutersfilexx-1459983274.jpg,True,en,"defaultdict(<class 'dict'>, {'viewport': 'width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=0', 'ahrefs-site-verification': '80d91b866834629ca6d4329f97e56e8b3e664a02379ef1426de12c9cf7ce2c34', 'fb': {'admins': 503171569, 'app_id': 278477199157577, 'pages': 111457038871331}, 'twitter': {'widgets': {'csp': 'on'}, 'card': 'summary_large_image', 'site': '@etribune', 'title': 'Minor boy ‘gang raped’ in Sialkot', 'description': 'Victim was kidnapped by four persons who took him to the fields and assaulted him', 'image': {'src': 'https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/1080003-rapereutersfilexx-1459983274/1080003-rapereutersfilexx-1459983274.jpg'}}, 'csrf-token': 'ugrH9rErFo3QA7NngIY2ymlnijJ535noz3J7Nmil', 'robots': 'noodp', 'og': {'locale': 'en_US', 'url': 'http://tribune.com.pk/story/2272629/minor-boy-gang-raped-in-sialkot', 'site_name': 'The Express Tribune', 'type': 'article', 'title': 'Minor boy ‘gang raped’ in Sialkot | The Express Tribune', 'description': 'Victim was kidnapped by four persons who took him to the fields and assaulted him', 'image': 'https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/1080003-rapereutersfilexx-1459983274/1080003-rapereutersfilexx-1459983274.jpg'}, 'description': 'Victim was kidnapped by four persons who took him to the fields and assaulted him', 'title': 'Minor boy ‘gang raped’ in Sialkot', 'article': {'publisher': 'https://tribune.com.pk', 'author': 'https://tribune.com.pk/author/190', 'section': 'Punjab', 'published_time': '2020-11-17T21:15:17+00:00'}})",[],1,1

In Jacobabad's Garhi Khero, a man allegedly strangled his wife to death for unknown reasons and fled. Police said the suspect was yet to be caught; however, the reason behind the murder could not be ascertained.

In Rajanpur, on the other hand, a man allegedly shot his wife dead and escaped, police confirmed. They added that the incident took place in the jurisdiction of the City Police station.

Elderly woman succumbs after stabbing, rape

A 70-year-old woman who was subjected to a horrific rape attempt here in the city's Quaidabad has succumbed to her injuries eight days later, police confirmed on Sunday.



According to district police officer (DPO) Khushab, Tariq Wilayat, the elderly woman was severely wounded as the suspect had attacked her with a knife and stabbed her multiple times. The man was said to be her neighbour and has been arrested, police said.

Police added that the rape attempt has been confirmed but the DNA report was yet to be received from the forensic laboratory.

Three separate rape incidents in Sargodha

At least three separate rape incidents were reported here in the city, police said Sunday.

In Sargodha's Mohriwala, a man allegedly attempted to rape a woman, police confirmed, adding that they registered a first information report (FIR) over the assault.

However, a search for the suspect was underway as he had fled after the crime.

In the second incident, which took place in the 8 North village, a man was arrested for allegedly attempting to sexually assault a minor girl, police said Sunday.

Two men booked for allegedly gang-raping teen

Two men have been booked for allegedly gang-raping a teenage girl here in the city's Bhabki area, police said Sunday.



Police said that a first information report (FIR) was filed on the request of the 14-year-old girl's brother, who said the suspects took his sister to an abandoned house where they allegedly raped her.

People gathered when she cried for help and the suspects consequently fled the crime scene, according to police.

They said that the girl would undergo a medical examination and raids were being carried out to search for and arrest the suspects.

Separately, a man allegedly harassed and attempted to assault a 15-year-old girl here in Janga Joiya near Vehari's Burewala, police said.

Young man arrested over rape claims

A young man was arrested for sexually assaulting a 14-year-old girl here in the provincial capital's Greater Iqbal Park, police said Sunday.



According to police, a boy and a girl arrived at a local Panagah here in Lahore last night to spend the night, raising suspicions with the shelter's management. When they questioned the girl, she said her neighbour had misled and lied to her in a bid to bring her to Greater Iqbal Park where he allegedly raped her.

The teenage girl recorded her statement with police, following which the suspect was detained. A first information report (FIR) was registered, police said, and an investigation is underway.

Five men attack boy, girl with knives

Five men allegedly attacked a young boy and girl with knives over what the teen claimed was a relationship dispute here in the city's Sherpao Colony, police said Sunday.



The 17-year-old girl claimed her paternal uncle and four other men were involved in the knife attack in Karachi that left her and her 21-year-old friend wounded. Police said both were shifted to hospital for medical attention.

The teen said her family had called the boy to their home under the guise of arranging their marriage but instead attacked them with knives.

Police said the suspects had managed to flee but a search to arrest them was underway.

Extortion, threatening with indecent video

Two police officers have been arrested for extorting money from a shopkeeper by threatening to publish an indecent video on social media and making it go viral, authorities said, adding that terrorism clauses were included in the case.

Both the accused — a sub-inspector and a constable of the Jhawarian police station — are set to be produced in a special anti-terrorism court tomorrow (Monday), police sources said.

The two were arrested three days ago on charges of extorting Rs3 million from the owner of a medical store. The suspects, along with other members of their gang, made an objectionable film of the medical store owner at gunpoint.

They also extorted money from the store owner by threatening to publish the video clip on the Internet and filing a bogus case against him.

Among the three suspects are two men and one woman, all of whom have been granted interim bail till September 25 by an additional sessions judge in Shahpur.

A medical examination confirmed on Wednesday the gang-rape.

Police said a group of suspects lured the woman, who is from Karachi, with the promise of a Rs40,000 job in Kashmore. The woman and suspects met at a hospital in Karachi.

The FIR says that the woman was offered a job on October 25. She travelled there with the men and her four-year-old daughter. The men then detained the pair at Malak’s residence in Kashmore and gang-raped the woman.

They then released her but kept her daughter, telling her to bring the woman who was with her during their meeting at the hospital in exchange for the child. They threatened to murder her daughter if the woman did not comply.

The woman approached the police in Kashmore, who conducted a raid at Malak’s residence. They saw three men, two of whom they identified on the spot as Muhammad Rafique Malak and Khairullah Bugti. They did not know the third man.

All three fled when they saw the police and jumped over a wall but Malak landed on a pile of bricks, injuring his legs. The police were able to arrest him but the other two fled. However, the police team has said on record that they will be able to identify the other two on sight.

The police found the child inside and Malak confessed that he had raped her because he was “furious” at her mother. The police confirmed that there were marks of violence on the child that made it apparent that she had been raped. Both the mother and child were shifted to the Taluka Hospital Kashmore.

The child has now been taken to a hospital in Larkana where she is in critical condition.

A case has been registered against Malik at the Kashmore police station under sections 376 (rape), 344 (wrongful confinement), 420 (cheating and dishonesty) and 34 (common intention) of the Pakistan Penal Code. It has been registered on behalf of the State.

Malak was presented before a Larkana court on Wednesday. He has been remanded into police custody for three days. The police said Malak is a resident of Kashmore and owned land there.

The police are on the lookout for the other two accomplices.

New weapons to use in rape cases in Pakistan

If you are ever raped in Pakistan one of the best things you can do is throw the law book at the cops because there have been many important legal changes that can work in your favour.

“A lot of us who have taken the police head on tell them Section this and Section that… [then] see how they take you seriously,” advises Sarah Zaman, a development specialist who headed War Against Rape for six years. “Then they realise that the person they are dealing with knows something and they shouldn’t pick a fight.”

Take for example the fact that a section has been deleted so that now the prosecution cannot bring up a victim’s sexual history during a rape case, which is a change most people are unaware of.

What you need to know has changed:

One of the biggest changes we need to know about is that rape (zina bil jabr) was finally separated from zina (adultery) and was made an offence under the Pakistan Penal Code instead of the Hudood Ordinance. “It stopped unproven cases of rape from being converted into those of fornication or adultery,” according to Bolobhi.org.

This change came about in 2006 as a result of the Protection of Women (Criminal Law Amendment) Act 2006. You will find rape in Section 375 of the Pakistan Penal Code now.

Ten years later, the law was changed again, in 2016, to the Criminal Law (Amendment) (Offense of Rape) Act 2016.

Why was this significant? Since the law was changed, not a single woman has been charged with zina and sent to languish in jail and several rape cases were reported and went to court, according to Farieha Aziz of Bolobhi, writing in Newsline magazine eight years ago.

If a public servant doesn’t do their job in a rape case, they can go to jail

Quote this section: Section 166(2) of the PPC

One of the biggest changes is that if any government servant doesn’t properly investigate a rape case or doesn’t diligently follow it, or doesn’t take the prosecution through to its logical conclusion, they can be sentenced to three years maximum and/or be fined.

“Medico-legal officers are public servants,” said Sarah Zaman. The law applies to a police officer, a jailor, a medical examiner. They are not allowed to intentionally create hurdles, mislead, jeopardise, or defeat an investigation.

“There are many cases where we know the police wallah is not doing his job,” said Zaman. “But we are not invoking the law against this.” People are not aware of the law so they can use it. You can now register a case against such government servants.

If a public official rapes then there is culpability for that too.

Deadlines on cases

Quote this section: Section 344(A), CrPC

A case of or attempt of abduction and kidnapping for illicit intercourse, rape, unnatural offences or sexual abuse must be decided within 3 months, after which it shall be sent to the notice of the Chief Justice of the High Court.

There is a time cap on rape case that they cannot take more than three months. “We looked at the data from Khyber Pakhtunkwa and there was not a single conviction that was given a verdict in three months,” said Zaman. (This sentence previously said ‘case’. It has been corrected to ‘conviction’. Verdicts have been passed and there have been acquittals).

The appeal has to happen in six months. If you factor in the time it takes to prepare an appeal, then any rape case can be wrapped up in a year’s time.

But she added that it was another matter if the rape case is settled out of court. They found that the KP prosecution services report said that 12 out of 38 cases were settled out of court. This was in 2016-2018 from district Nowshera, KP. It was called a “compromise”.

“But we know that compromise was finished from the law in 2006,” said Zaman. “Muafi sullah, muq-muqa, none of this can happen any more.”

Anyone can look up a famous 2013 judgement of the Supreme Court that clearly says this in a Rawalpindi case in which a father took one million rupees in compromise.

You can’t give ID of victims

Quote this section: Section 352, CrPC

Trial to be in camera: Trials of cases of abduction and kidnapping for illicit intercourse, rape, unnatural offences and sexual abuse shall be conducted in camera. An application made by parties, may result in allowing particular persons to have access to or remain in Court. Special measures may be adopted for protection of victim etc. including use of screens, video link etc.

Another thing in the new law is that the victim’s identity will not be disclosed. If there is an alleged rape, not even an FIR, you cannot broadcast the information anywhere, nor can you share any of the information, without explicit permission from the court. (This sentence previously said ‘information’. The correct word was ‘permission).

The trial from day one till the end will be done in camera, meaning in the judge’s chamber or in a private place. The trial includes everything from statements to the cross examination. There are supposed to be screens but this is not always possible in our courtrooms, which are often (but not always) too small. This is a very sobering point to note for the media that jumps to cover rape stories.

Female supervision

Quote this section: Section 164A CrPC

Quote this section: Section 161A CrPC

Right to legal representation: The police officer shall inform the victim of her right to legal representation after recording information of an offence or an attempt of offence.

An Investigation Officer or IO will register the FIR—not a head moharrar, added Zaman. It has to happen in the presence of a female police officer. If a female officer is not available, then it should be done in the presence of a female family member. The police have to maintain a referral directory of lawyers and tell everyone woman in a rape case that she has the right to a lawyer. They have to share their names and their numbers. But as Sarah Zaman pointed out, this system is not in place anywhere.","['Ghulam Mustafa', 'Naya Din']","A man identified as Rafiq Malak has been arrested for raping a woman and her four-year-old daughter in Kashmore, police said on Tuesday.

Lahore Capital City Police Officer Omar Sheikh told The Express Tribune that SHO Gujjarpura Shahzeb Khan had received a message that two sisters had died of electrocution in a house in the Janipura area.

The SHO said that when he reached the house, about two dozen men and women had gathered there to mourn. When the police enquired about the girls' death, their father, Manzoor, said his two daughters, 15-year-old Kiran and 16-year-old Maryam, had died of electric shock from a washing machine.

The police official said he asked Manzoor to show him the scene of the incident. The father took the police to a small yard at the back of the house where the washing machine was placed. The police officials found that the machine was made of plastic and dry. When they asked the father to show them the clothes that the girls were washing, he failed to do so. On further questioning, he said Kiran's body had been found lying near the machine, while Maryam's body was on the upper floor of the house.

The SHO said that Manzoor later confessed that he had killed the two girls by strangling them. Police took him into custody and sent the bodies to a morgue for autopsy.

Manzoor revealed during interrogation that his son was also involved in the murders along with him.

He stated before SP Civil Lines Safdar Raza Kazmi that he had arranged the marriages of his both daughters with his relatives but they had refused and said they wanted to marry someone else. On this the father and son became enraged and killed them both.

In the other incident, police received a call on the emergency phone number that a woman and her daughter had been found dead in their home in Green Town. The mother, Nadia, was 36 years old, while the daughter was aged three. Both had been slaughtered with a sharp tool. Police took the bodies into custody and started investigation.

SSP Investigation Abdul Ghaffar Qaisarani said Nadia had contracted second marriage and lived in a separate flat, but her husband’s son from his first marriage was enraged over their relationship. He said evidence collected by the police from the scene indicated that the woman’s stepson had committed the murders with the help of his uncle. The police were trying to arrest the suspects.

Geo.tv/Illustration/Files

LAHORE: Police on Thursday booked and arrested three individuals, including a domestic help and a woman, for allegedly strangling an elderly woman to death in the provincial capital's Defence Housing Authority (DHA) area.



Police confirmed that they arrested a man identified as Hassan — the deceased's domestic help — as well as his wife Iqra and a relative called Ashiq. The suspects, they added, were accused of beating the 70-year-old Shahida on her head with sticks and then strangling her to death.



The three suspects had fled the elderly woman's home with Rs15 million worth of saving certificates and gold jewellery, police said, adding that they were yet to recover the looted items.

The couple had reportedly started working as domestic help at Shahida's home around 12 days ago. They allegedly planned the robbery after realising she lived alone and had their relative, Ashiq, join their planned crime.

Earlier on Monday, police had said they had recovered the body of an elderly woman from a house in Block N of DHA Phase 1, where she lived by herself. The body was moved to a morgue for post-mortem, they had said at the time.

Police had also said the domestic help who worked at the woman's house had gone missing after the alleged murder. A first information report (FIR) was registered on behalf of the elderly woman's brother.

An individual who lives in the same locality as the deceased had informed Geo.tv that police said the alleged murder took place around 9am and that the woman had tried to run but had either tripped or was pushed, causing her head to burst open.

Her attackers likely captured her before she could escape, strangling her with an elastic band often used in trousers, the individual had told Geo.tv. Her immediate family lived abroad but her relatives were in Pakistan these days, they had added.

The individual further told Geo.tv that the domestic help was present earlier in the day, claiming the deceased was not feeling well.",['Web Desk'],"Geo.tv/Illustration/FilesLAHORE: Police on Thursday booked and arrested three individuals, including a domestic help and a woman, for allegedly strangling an elderly woman to death in the provincial capital's Defence Housing Authority (DHA) area.

LAHORE: Motorway police said a kidnapping attempt was foiled near Sahianwala on Sunday, after a couple of persons tried to lure a woman on to a bus with promises of a fake job.



The woman called the motorway police helpline after she got suspicious, following which the accused fled the scene, police added.

After taking the required measures, police handed the woman over to her family members.

Last month, two armed men allegedly raped a woman stranded with her children on the motorway before robbing her of money and other valuables, according to a police report on the incident.

The woman, a resident of Gujranwala, was on her way back to the city from Lahore's Ring Road at 01:30AM, when her car ran out of petrol near Gujjarpura around an hour later.

The woman waited for her husband and phoned a relative for help, who advised her to call the Motorway Police. She subsequently called the Motorway Police's 130 emergency helpline for assistance, but was told by the operator that she could not be provided help as the emergency beat had not been assigned to anyone.

While she was stranded on the road, two unidentified armed persons are believed to have arrived on foot from a nearby area and smashed the window of her car, forcing the woman and her children out of the vehicle. They then cut through the fence along the motorway and raped the woman in the fields nearby in the presence of her children, the FIR of the incident says.

The woman had said that the men then deprived her of Rs100,000, jewellery and ATM cards before fleeing.

The incident stoked anger and triggered protests around the country, with many people questioning why the motorway police had been unable to prevent the crime from occurring.

The woman had said that the men then deprived her of Rs100,000, jewellery and ATM cards before fleeing.","['kidnap', 'near', 'foiled', 'road', 'motorway', 'sahianwala', 'say', 'children', 'taking', 'stranded', 'raped', 'persons', 'woman', 'attempt', 'nearby']","{'https://www.geo.tv/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-28/s_326928_072652_updates.jpg', 'https://www.geo.tv/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-28/l_326908_050610_updates.jpg', 'https://www.geo.tv/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-28/l_326902_042740_updates.jpg', 'https://www.geo.tv/assets/uploads/reporters/796_070014_reporter.jpg', 'https://www.geo.tv/assets/front/images/geo-loader.gif', 'https://www.geo.tv/assets/front/images/geo-logo.svg', 'https://www.geo.tv//assets/front/images/detail-twitter.svg', 'https://www.geo.tv/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-28/l_326906_050409_updates.jpg', 'https://www.geo.tv/assets/front/images/logo.svg', 'https://www.geo.tv/assets/front/images/GEO-TV-ICONS1.png', 'https://www.geo.tv/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-28/s_326922_064040_updates.jpg', 'https://www.geo.tv/assets/front/images/logo-green.svg', 'https://www.geo.tv/assets/front/images/Menu-green.svg', 'https://www.geo.tv/assets/uploads/updates/2020-10-04/311405_7238857_updates.jpg', 'https://www.geo.tv/assets/front/images/desktop_search.svg', 'https://www.geo.tv/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-28/l_326899_043650_updates.jpg', 'https://www.geo.tv/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-28/l_326887_031940_updates.jpg', 'https://www.geo.tv/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-28/l_326922_064040_updates.jpg', 'https://www.geo.tv//assets/front/images/detail-facebook.svg', 'https://www.geo.tv/assets/front/images/Menu-white.svg', 'https://www.geo.tv/assets/front/images/GEO-TV-ICONS2.png', 'https://www.geo.tv//assets/front/images/print.svg', 'https://www.geo.tv/assets/front/images/geo-menus-icons/search.svg', 'https://www.geo.tv/assets/front/images/close.svg', 'https://www.geo.tv/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-28/l_326910_061721_updates.jpg', 'https://www.geo.tv/assets/front/images/logo-blue.svg?111', 'https://www.geo.tv//assets/front/images/geo-menus-icons/search.svg', 'https://www.geo.tv/assets/front/images/logo-blue.svg?124', 'https://www.geo.tv//assets/front/images/time.svg', 'https://www.geo.tv/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-28/s_326910_061721_updates.jpg', 'https://www.geo.tv/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-28/l_326884_025334_updates.jpg', 'https://www.geo.tv/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-28/l_326907_054905_updates.jpg', 'https://www.geo.tv//assets/front/images/geo-logo.svg', 'https://www.geo.tv/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-28/l_326897_040008_updates.jpg', 'https://www.geo.tv/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-28/l_326916_064508_updates.jpg', 'https://www.geo.tv/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-28/l_326901_042732_updates.jpg', 'https://www.geo.tv/assets/uploads/updates/2020-10-04/311405_084319_updates.jpg', 'https://www.geo.tv/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-28/s_326916_064508_updates.jpg', 'https://www.geo.tv/assets/front/images/Menu-blue.svg', 'https://www.geo.tv//assets/front/images/detail-whatsapp.svg', 'https://www.geo.tv//assets/front/images/logo-green-white.svg'}",True,https://www.geo.tv/assets/uploads/updates/2020-10-04/311405_084319_updates.jpg,True,en,"defaultdict(<class 'dict'>, {'fb': {'app_id': 806127442825208}, 'viewport': 'width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0', 'TITLE': 'Attempt to kidnap woman foiled at Sahianwala, say motorway police | Pakistan - Geo.tv', 'description': 'Suspects tried to lure a woman on to a bus with fake promises of a job, say motorway police', 'keywords': 'Motorway Police, Punjab,', 'og': {'title': 'Attempt to kidnap woman foiled at Sahianwala, say motorway police', 'image': 'https://www.geo.tv/assets/uploads/updates/2020-10-04/311405_084319_updates.jpg', 'description': 'Suspects tried to lure a woman on to a bus with fake promises of a job, say motorway police', 'url': 'https://www.geo.tv/latest/311405-attempt-to-kidnap-woman-foiled-at-sahianwala-say-motorway-police', 'type': 'article'}, 'twitter': {'card': 'summary_large_image', 'site': '@geonews_english', 'creator': '@Web Desk', 'title': 'Attempt to kidnap woman foiled at Sahianwala, say motorway police', 'description': 'Suspects tried to lure a woman on to a bus with fake promises of a job, say motorway police', 'image': 'https://www.geo.tv/assets/uploads/updates/2020-10-04/311405_084319_updates.jpg'}, 'robots': 'max-image-preview:large', 'apple-mobile-web-app-capable': 'yes', 'apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style': 'black-translucent', 'apple-mobile-web-app-title': 'Geo News', 'msapplication-TileImage': 'https://www.geo.tv/assets/front/images/gn-icons/144x144.png', 'msapplication-TileColor': '#ffffff', 'theme-color': '#0D3975'})",[],1,1

On October 2, the woman's husband, Muhammad Hanif Jat, had attempted to torch her alive after spraying oil over her body, police said. The attack occurred in their house in Gharo, a town in Sindh's Thatta district.

The husband brought the woman to a local hospital for treatment on the same day, where he told the administration that she had been burnt by accident.

However, the victim negated his claim on Friday and told police in her statement that she had been subjected to physical abuse over the past four months ""for giving birth to a girl"". The abuse had culminated in the husband attempting to burn her alive.

Police have arrested the husband while the woman is still undergoing treatment.","['Imtiaz Ali', 'Imtiaz Ali Khan', 'Asif', 'A.

In an interview to Dunya News, the girl explained that Zohaib Hussain is her relative and brought her some ice for the water cooler. When she went to wash the ice, Hussain entered her house.

“He tried to molest and harass me but Allah saved me and I ran away. I am so grateful to God that he saved my honor,” she said.

“My younger brother came when I screamed for help. He [brother] kicked him [Hussain] and by then another younger brother had also woken up… that is when [Hussain] left the house. I then went running to my mother.”

The girl’s family says her father and uncle were beaten up and jailed for almost four hours after they refused to forgive the offender during a meeting on September 19. They said Hussain raped two other girls in the village, but was never caught due to his family’s influence.

An FIR was registered against Hussain at the Hangor Ja police station under Section 376 (rape) and Section 511 (attempt to commit offenses) of the Pakistan Penal Code.

A person close to the family told SAMAA Digital that the girl’s family has now moved because of continuous threats from Hussain and his family.

According to SAMAA TV correspondent Shafique Shar, this is the 15th rape-related news report within a month that has been reported from Khairpur.

Correction: This story earlier mentioned that the suspect was arrested and in police custody, however, sources within the department say the suspect is out of jail on pre-arrest bail. The police are not confirming this development.","['Shafiq Shar', 'Web Desk', 'Jahangir Akram Khan']","A 12-year-old girl managed to escape a rape attempt by a known sex offender in her village in Khairpur on September 17.

He said action would be taken on receiving complaint from the victim girl or her family.

On Friday, the police produced the woman in the court of senior civil judge (admin) Jasmshed Kundi for hearing into her bail application.

Sajid Mehmood fired two bullets at her as she walked towards the jail van in the parking area of district courts along with a woman constable.

The woman was shifted to the Haripur Trauma Centre from where she was referred to the Ayub Medical Complex, Abbottabad.

However, she died on the way to Abbottabad.

According to a first information report registered at the Sir Syed Police Station on the complaint of the victim's father, the child had left his house in Bilal Colony on Tuesday morning to play with his friends. A couple of hours later, he was found in a semi-conscious state with torture marks on his body. The complainant further said that there was blood in the victim's stool.

The victim's father told police that he suspected that someone had kidnapped his son and attempted to subject him to sodomy.

The victim was first taken to the Abbasi Shaheed Hospital and was later shifted to the JPMC, where he passed away earlier today, said Dr Summaiya Syed, the hospital's additional police surgeon.

She said that an autopsy had not been conducted and the hospital had only issued a death certificate, which mentioned assault as the cause of death. She added that sexual assault of the child could not be ruled out.

Station House Officer (SHO) Nawaz Ali Brohi, meanwhile, said that an autopsy was not required as the victim had been examined by the doctors when he was brought to the hospital.

The SHO said that the perpetrator may have been a teenager.

Police had earlier filed an FIR under Sections 363 (punishment for kidnapping) and 337(A) (Shajja /bodily injuries) of the Pakistan Penal Code. The police will now include a murder section as well.","['Imtiaz Ali', 'Muqali Khan', 'Azam Jan', 'Chrís Dăń', 'Anwar Syed. St.Louis. Mo.

Speaking to Dawn.com, acting Karachi police chief Additional IG Arif Hanif confirmed that the 13-year-old girl had been recovered safely and her purported husband had also been arrested.

The city police chief said the girl would be sent to a shelter home as per the directions of the Sindh High Court (SHC) while the suspect would be presented before the court on Tuesday.

Earlier in the day, the SHC had ordered the police to recover Arzoo and shift her to a shelter home.

""The judge has ordered the girl be recovered by police and relevant agencies and shifted to a shelter home. Next hearing fixed for Thursday morning [November 5]. My lawyer has informed the court that an intervener will be filed on my behalf,"" Minister for Human Rights Shireen Mazari said in a tweet.

Activist and lawyer Jibran Nasir — who is part of the legal team fighting the case on behalf of Arzoo's parents — also confirmed the development, adding that the SHC had directed that the girl be produced before the court at the next hearing. Speaking to Dawn.com, he said the court in the meantime has ordered that a medical test be conducted to determine the girl's age.

The court noted that issues to be addressed are the girl's age, whether she was forcibly converted and if her marriage is legal, he said.

""I trust the Sindh government and the police would use all resources at their disposal"" to recover Arzoo, he said.

""To save our children, the government, judiciary, lawyers, civil society and the media should all be on the same page. We all need to play our respective roles effectively,"" he said.

""Glad both the Sindh government and the federal government want to pursue #JusticeForArzoo. There is a lot to learn from the injustices committed in this case first by the accused and then by our governance system. With both governments on board hope this case will become ground for renewed focus on child rights,"" he added.

Sindh government spokesperson Wahab added that the court had issued the directives on an application filed by the provincial government.

Sindh Governor Imran Ismail said Arzoo's case would be solved according to the law. ""There can be no compromise on cases involving underage marriage,"" he said while meeting representatives of minority communities at the Governor House.

The alleged abduction of 13-year-old Arzoo last month had sparked protests from human rights groups against her purported forced conversion and underage marriage with a Muslim man.

According to the first information report of the case registered on his complaint, Arzoo's father Raja stated that on October 13, he and his wife went to work while their son Shahbaz had gone to school. The complainant said his three daughters, including Arzoo, were present at their home in Railway Colony when he received a call from a relative, who told him that Arzoo was missing from the house.

Raja said he reached home and contacted their neighbours, but could not trace his daughter. He subsequently lodged a case regarding the abduction of his daughter against unknown persons at the Frere police station.

Arzoo's family members earlier this month told Dawn that her purported husband Azhar lived in a house opposite theirs along with his family and he was at least 45-years-old. ""The rascal who abducted her has prepared fake papers to show that she is 18-years-old,” her mother said.

Police had booked Syed Ali Azhar, the girl's alleged husband, and arrested his brothers, Syed Shariq Ali, Syed Mohsin Ali, and a friend, Danish, for allegedly abducting the underage girl, purportedly forcibly converting her and marrying her to a Muslim man.

On Saturday, a judicial magistrate had dismissed an application filed by Arzoo's family pleading to send her to a shelter home. Arzoo's father had filed an application under Rule 5 of the Child Marriages Restraint Rules read with Rules 8, 9 and 10 of the Child Marriages Restrain Act, 2013 and Section 100 of the criminal procedure code.

Nasir had argued that girl was 13, therefore, the provisions of the Sindh Child Marriages Restrain Act had also been incorporated in the matter by the investigating agency.

He had argued that the relevant documents concerning the victim's age had already been provided by the complainant to the investigating officer and the same were showing her age as 13 years.

Nasir had contended that further stay of the victim with suspect Azhar would amount to an offence punishable under Section 376 (punishment for rape) of the Pakistan Penal Code read with Section 375(v) (rape: with or without her consent when she is under sixteen years of age).

He had said that the complainant was not even asking for the custody of the victim, as he had no objection sending her to a shelter home for DNA testing and other requirements for the investigation.

The investigating officer in the case, Inspector Shariq Ahmed Siddiqui, had stated that the victim had appeared before the SHC and was sent under the protection of the SHO of the Preedy police station in compliance with the court's Oct 27 order.

He said he had called in verification of the victim's B-form, which as per the National Database and Registration Authority, was genuine.","['Dawn.Com', 'Imtiaz Ali', 'Vivek Lahore', 'Peer Baba Khwajaji', 'Iftikhar Husain', 'Surya Kant', 'Nitin Saini', 'M.

On Saturday, a judicial magistrate had dismissed an application filed by Arzoo's family pleading to send her to a shelter home.","['arzoo', 'underage', 'sindh', 'filed', 'arzoos', 'girl', '13yearold', 'court', 'shc', 'family', 'orders', 'marriage', 'case', 'recovered', 'wahab', 'shelter']","{'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fe9499488c1c.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fe97fbf0bffc.png?r=86833981', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fe9b387cc5f6.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fe9c85c35a3d.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42ce48d.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fe97c0454655.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fe4949f031b3.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42d40e8.png', 'https://www.dawn.com/_img/search.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fe7ee10e5698.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2020/12/5fe8760883a11.jpg', 'https://www.dawn.com/_img/logo--white.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fe9ca9c3eb2f.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fe949554d3c4.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fe874c6aab53.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42cf5e8.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fe994194503f.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fe9cac9580f3.jpg', 'https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=1DJ3k1acFH00UN', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fe998d666465.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/large/2020/11/5f9fc065efe40.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fe94d2031b8d.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c42d5669.png', 'https://www.dawn.com/_img/logo.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2019/02/5c611c430f9b2.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fe8eea0976da.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fe949febf527.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/primary/2020/11/5f9fc065efe40.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fe9897a49f31.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fe9a7b397421.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/thumbnail/2020/12/5fe7eccad84e9.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fe94a4ed5084.jpg', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2017/06/5931466588b47.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fe9951cb1d70.png', 'https://i.dawn.com/medium/2020/12/5fe3908657ba9.jpg'}",True,https://i.dawn.com/large/2020/11/5f9fc065efe40.jpg,True,en,"defaultdict(<class 'dict'>, {'viewport': 'width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1', 'subject': 'Your window to latest news, analysis and features from Pakistan, South Asia and the world.', 'description': ""Teenage Christian girl's purported husband arrested; Arzoo to be sent to a shelter home."", 'fb': {'app_id': 1383068068604634, 'pages': 86398345441}, 'og': {'locale': 'en_US', 'site_name': 'DAWN.COM', 'url': 'https://www.dawn.com/news/1588201', 'type': 'article', 'title': 'Underage marriage: 13-year-old Arzoo recovered after SHC orders, says Wahab', 'description': ""Teenage Christian girl's purported husband arrested; Arzoo to be sent to a shelter home."", 'image': 'https://i.dawn.com/large/2020/11/5f9fc065efe40.jpg'}, 'twitter': {'card': 'summary', 'site': '@dawn_com', 'url': 'https://www.dawn.com/news/1588201', 'title': 'Underage marriage: 13-year-old Arzoo recovered after SHC orders, says Wahab', 'description': ""Teenage Christian girl's purported husband arrested; Arzoo to be sent to a shelter home."", 'image': 'https://i.dawn.com/large/2020/11/5f9fc065efe40.jpg'}, 'article': {'publisher': 'https://www.dawn.com', 'published_time': '2020-11-02 13:17:36', 'modified_time': '2020-11-02 22:06:17', 'tag': 'Violence against Christians', 'author': 'https://www.dawn.com/authors/1200/imtiaz-ali'}, 'keywords': 'Violence against Christians', 'news_keywords': 'Violence against Christians', 'author': 'Dawn.com | Imtiaz Ali'})",[],1,1

Ali said that fellow transgender Heera Malik was allegedly attacked and tortured by unidentified men on October 31 in Sector F-11 of the federal capital.

Even though a complaint was filed, Ali said the police have yet to register a First Information Report (FIR) for the incident while constantly shifting responsibility to another station.

“We face discrimination and harassment daily and are excluded from society,” she lamented during a news briefing. A recent spell of violence against the transgender community, she said, is highly disturbing.

“Many of us are afraid to venture out [of our homes] due to fear of attacks”.

Ali urged the government to ensure the implementation of Transgender Persons Act 2018, to prevent such incidents from taking place in the future.

Earlier in October, Ali had said that another transgender person was seriously injured after being shot while returning to Shah Mansoor after performing at a musical concert in Buner.

“The authorities must take serious steps to investigate these brutal attacks and killings,” Ali lamented. She added that the authorities need to ensure the safety of the transgender community as they are amongst the most vulnerable sections of society.

The law, Ali said, explicitly prohibits the discrimination and harassment of transgenders and protects their right to access public spaces. While the law was promulgated, its implementation remains weak as the community still faces rampant violence.

The PTA also claimed that in certain incidents, the authorities are complicit in discrimination and harassment .

SUKKUR: The main suspect nominated in the murder of a young woman last week has been arrested, Sanghar Police confirmed late Wednesday.



According to the senior superintendent of police (SSP) for Sanghar, Usman Ghani Siddiqui, the primary suspect identified as Taj Muhammed alias Taju Shar had shot dead his sister, Gulshana Shar, five days ago in what was allegedly part of the karo kari tradition and fled.

SSP Siddiqui added that he had constituted a special task force under deputy superintendent of police (DSP) Peer Allah Rakhio to arrest the main suspect Taju Shar and that the team accomplished its assignment.



Gulshana Shar's father, Muhab Shar, had registered a first information report against the suspect, he noted.

The cop termed the law and order situation in Sanghar as satisfactory, saying police had managed to control street crimes, social crimes, and drug trafficking.



A local media outlet, however, reported that the young woman and her father had appealed to the authorities for protection after her husband reportedly wished to murder her over the so-called ""honour"".

Gulshana Shar was also said to have issued a video statement wherein she had claimed that she was scared that she would be killed either by her brother or husband.

Following the murder, her family also reportedly faced difficulties in transporting the body to the hospital for postmortem.",[],"Geo.tv/Illustration/FilesSUKKUR: The main suspect nominated in the murder of a young woman last week has been arrested, Sanghar Police confirmed late Wednesday.

However, dozens of transgender persons blocked a road at the District Council Chowk and protested against the police for not arresting the accused. The Batala Colony DSP held talks with the protesters and assured them of arresting the accused at the earliest.

Zahid Yaqoob, a resident of Dawood Nagar, lodged a complaint at Batala Colony police station, stating that he was going towards the Fateh Din area in a rickshaw when eight armed accused, including Omar Hayat, Shahid Ali and Abdullah Omar, stopped it at Kabar Khana Chowk on Hilal Road.

The complainant said the accused dragged him out from the rickshaw and tortured him. Later, they kidnapped him and took him to their place, where they tortured him. While his accomplices held him, Hayat cut off his hair and beat him.

Yaqoob said the accused also recorded a video clip of him and snatched Rs60,000 in cash and three-tola gold jewellery, including a chain, a ring and earrings from him. Batala Colony police registered a case against the accused.

After the incident, local transgender persons protested at District Council Chowk, alleging that the police were not arresting the accused involved in the abduction and torture. The blockade of road by the protesters, who were shouting slogans against the police, left vehicles stuck in long queues of traffic.

The actress (M) had lodged a complaint against the policeman (K) for taking her to a hotel in Garden Town for a dance function and raping her there. She said she was a dancer by profession and the suspect had hired her to dance in a party. She said the suspect fled after raping her.

The police registered the rape case against the suspect and arrested him.

Punjab Inspector General of Police (IGP) Inam Ghani took notice of the incident and sought a report on it from the capital city police officer (CCPO). He ordered a departmental inquiry into the charges against the suspect and provision of justice for the woman.

MURDER: A man was stabbed to death by the husband of the woman he used to call in the Badami Bagh area on Sunday.

The police said Sultan, 25, of Toba Tek Singh was working at Haji Ashraf’s warehouse for the last five years. On Sunday morning, one Amjad of Narowal approached the warehouse and asked for Sultan. When Sultan came there, Amjad attacked him with a knife and stabbed him to death.

The police shifted the body to the morgue for autopsy and registered the case.

The suspect later approached the police station and courted arrest. He told the police that Sultan was making calls to his wife on phone for quite some time and he had stopped him many times in the past from doing so. When Sultan did not stop, he killed him for honour.

Police claim the minor boy's family taught him how to use a gun to kill his paternal aunt, who had married by choice a decade ago — before he was even born.

Kanwal Parveen, a resident of 104 North village, had married a person of her choosing 10 years ago. However, her action upset her family who did not accept her wedding, and did not have good relations with her, said police.



On September 14, Kanwal's family invited her to celebrate the birth of her nephew at their home where her other nephew, a nine-year-old boy, shot her to death.

Police said the woman was killed in a pre-planned manner and that a first information report (FIR) was registered against both the boy and the two suspects who had allegedly trained him to carry out the killing.

The Saddar police station house officer (SHO), Zafar Shah, said the suspected killer — the minor boy — was probably not even born when Kanwal tied the knot 10 years ago. ""It is very likely that his family informed him about his aunt and how she opted to marry by her choice.

""That's why, the boy shot his aunt dead,"" Shah added, referring to cases of honour-killings in Pakistan, some of which have been similar in the sense that a child was coerced or motivated to kill an elder for a perceived slight to the family's honour.",[],"SARGODHA: A nine-year-old boy allegedly shot dead his paternal aunt for marrying by choice in the city's 104 North village area, police said Tuesday, in what is being termed the latest case of killing over the so-called ""honour"".

According to Killa Abdullah Assistant Commissioner Jahanzeb Sheikh, unidentified persons raped and strangled the child to death in Kali Davian area in the suburbs of Killa Abdullah.

A search for the child was launched two days ago (on Wednesday) after he left his madressah temporarily but did not return to the seminary nor reached his home.

His body was later found hanging from a tree on Wednesday evening, Sheikh said, adding that a first-information report was registered the same day against unidentified persons and authorities were carrying out a search operation to arrest them.

The report of a post-mortem examination performed on the child in Quetta proved that two people had sexually assaulted him, he said.

The incident has come to light two days after the body of a two-and-a-half-year-old girl, Zainab, who had gone missing on Tuesday evening while playing with other children outside her house, was found near Charsadda.

On Thursday, Charsadda police said the minor girl appeared to have been assaulted and tortured before being killed.

The hashtags #JusticeforZainab and #AnotherZainab were used on Twitter by netizens to express outrage over unabated cases of abuse and murder of children in the country.

Photos of the child's body were circulated on social media with many users comparing the incident to the 2018 rape and murder of eight-year-old Zainab Amin in Kasur.

Zainab Amin had gone missing on Jan 4, 2018, and five days later, a police constable deputed to trace the girl recovered her body from a heap of trash near the Shahbaz Khan Road.

Being the 12th such incident to occur within a 10-kilometre radius in Kasur in one year, Zainab's rape and murder had sparked outrage and protests across the country.

In March, a report by the NGO Sahil had revealed that a total of 2,846 child abuse cases were reported from across the country in 2019, with data showing that more than eight children suffered some form of abuse every day in Pakistan last year.","['Ghalib Nihad', 'Sher Jang Gilgit-Baltistan', 'Raja Gilal', 'Nomi Goraya', 'Dr. Salaria', 'Aamir Ahmad', 'Chrís Dăń', 'Tanvir Khan', 'Azam', 'Maliha Rehman']","An eight-year-old boy, whose body was found hanging from a tree, was murdered after allegedly being raped in Balochistan's Killa Abdullah district, it emerged on Friday.

“The 17-year-old victim was gang-raped by three men in the mid of July in 2019. The suspects were jailed but freed within a few months after obtaining bail,” said the victim’s father and relatives.

They told journalists that the victim went into depression after the suspects started blackmailing her again after getting out of jail. The suspects had also filmed the victim when they sexually assaulted her by turns at their home.

The then SSP Abdullah Ahmedyar said that initial medical reports had confirmed the assault on the girl. But the suspects were released after their DNA tests came negative, said the sources.

Chelhar police had arrested one Adam Dal after the girl’s suicide but no fresh case had been registered against the accused. Dal and his accomplices Qabool Rahimoon and Sawai Mal Meghwar were the main suspects nominated in the FIR about the gang-rape.

Rights activists condemned the rape victim’s suicide and demanded action against all the suspects who had compelled the girl to take her life.
